    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tokyo Tower is a communications and observation tower located in the Shiba-koen district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It was completed in 1958 and stands at a height of 333 meters (1,092 feet), making it the second tallest structure in Japan after the Tokyo Skytree. The tower's design is inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, and it is painted in white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.
